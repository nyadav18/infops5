### Load and Check Data

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
gapminder_data <- read_delim("gapminder.csv")
```
This dataset has `r nrow(gapminder_data)` rows and `r ncol(gapminder_data)`
columns.
```{r}
print(head(gapminder_data))
```
My small sample of data does look ok! It does look like there are a lot of missing values though.

### Descriptive Statistics

```{r}
num_iso3 <- length(unique(gapminder_data$iso3))
num_name <- length(unique(gapminder_data$name))
num_iso2 <- length(unique(gapminder_data$iso2))
```
Each of the three variables to be evaluated for question 1 in this section has a different number of unique elements. According to `iso3`, there are `r num_iso3` countries. According to `name`, there are `r num_name` countries. And according to `iso2`, there are `r num_iso2` countries.
